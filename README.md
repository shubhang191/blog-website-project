# blog-website-project
this is a blog website which i made using html and basic javascript

# My JS Blog App

This is a simple CRUD application built with Vanilla JavaScript.

**Features:**
- Create new blog posts with images.
- Data is persisted using Local Storage.
- Delete posts.

**Note to Reviewers:**
- Since this uses Local Storage, the blog will appear empty when you first visit the link. Please try adding a post to see it in action
- Since i had no prior experience in coding before, and had only limited knowledge of html, css and basic javascript, i followed a youtube tutorial to make this
website, coding along with the tutorial and took some help from ai in understanding exactly what was going on in each line of code
